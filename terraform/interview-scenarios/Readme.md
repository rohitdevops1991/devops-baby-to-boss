### Section 1 üîπ **Core Concepts & Basics**

1. **What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and how does Terraform support it?**

   **Answer:** IaC allows infrastructure to be provisioned and managed using code instead of manual processes. Terraform enables this by using HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) to declare resources like servers, storage, networking, etc. It allows repeatability, version control, and automation across multiple providers.

2. **What are the key features of Terraform compared to Ansible or CloudFormation?**

   **Answer:**
   * Declarative syntax (vs procedural in Ansible)
   * Provider-agnostic (unlike CloudFormation which is AWS-specific)
   * State tracking
   * Dependency resolution
   * Modular architecture

3. **Explain the difference between `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply`.**

   **Answer:**
   * `init`: Initializes working directory and downloads providers.
   * `plan`: Shows what changes Terraform will make.
   * `apply`: Executes the changes described in the plan.

4. **What is the `.terraform` directory used for?**

   **Answer:** It stores provider plugins, modules, and local workspace data.

5. **What file formats does Terraform use?**

   **Answer:**
   * `.tf` for configuration files
   * `.tf.json` (JSON version of `.tf`)
   * `.tfstate` for state data
   * `.terraform.lock.hcl` for provider version locking

6. **What is a provider in Terraform?**

   **Answer:** A provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to manage resources from a specific platform (AWS, Azure, GitHub, etc.). It defines available resource types and APIs.

7. **How does Terraform manage state?**

   **Answer:** Terraform uses a `.tfstate` file to track the current state of infrastructure. It compares this to the desired state in `.tf` files to determine what needs to be added, changed, or destroyed.

8. **What is a resource block?**

   **Answer:** A block that defines an infrastructure object.

   ```hcl
   resource "aws_instance" "web" {
     ami = "ami-123456"
     instance_type = "t2.micro"
   }
   ```

9. **What are `variables` in Terraform?**

   **Answer:** Variables allow dynamic input into configurations. Defined with `variable "name"` and used with `${var.name}` or just `var.name`.

10. **What is an `output` in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** Outputs expose values from your Terraform configuration, useful for debugging or passing data to external scripts/modules.

    ```hcl
    output "instance_ip" {
      value = aws_instance.web.public_ip
    }
    ```

11. **What is `terraform fmt`?**

    **Answer:** Formats Terraform code to canonical style (indentation, spacing, etc.).

12. **How do you validate Terraform configuration?**

    **Answer:** Use `terraform validate` to check for syntax or semantic issues without making changes.

13. **What does `terraform taint` do?**

    **Answer:** Marks a resource for forced destruction and recreation during the next apply.

14. **What‚Äôs the difference between `terraform destroy` and `apply -destroy`?**

    **Answer:** Both remove all resources, but `terraform destroy` is explicit. `apply -destroy` is rarely used and less readable.

15. **Can Terraform use loops? How?**

    **Answer:** Yes. With `count`, `for_each`, and `for` expressions.

    ```hcl
    resource "aws_instance" "web" {
      count = 3
      ami = "ami-123"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"
    }
    ```

16. **What is the Terraform state file and why is it important?**

    **Answer:** It stores the current snapshot of the infrastructure. Terraform uses it to detect changes and avoid re-creating resources unnecessarily.

17. **What are the risks of sharing state files directly?**

    **Answer:**
    * Risk of corruption during concurrent updates
    * Exposure of sensitive data (e.g., passwords)
    * Manual errors

18. **What are backends in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** Backends determine how state is stored and managed. Examples: `local`, `s3`, `gcs`, `azurerm`, `consul`, `remote`.

19. **How does a remote backend like S3 work?**

    **Answer:** Stores state in an S3 bucket with optional DynamoDB table for state locking.

20. **Why is state locking important?**

    **Answer:** Prevents simultaneous operations from corrupting state. Enabled using backends like S3 + DynamoDB.

21. **Difference between `local` and `remote` backend?**

    **Answer:**
    * `local`: State file stored on disk
    * `remote`: State stored in cloud (S3, etc.), supporting collaboration and locking

22. **How do you migrate from one backend to another?**

    **Answer:**
    1. Update backend config
    2. Run `terraform init`
    3. Terraform will prompt to migrate state

23. **What are Terraform workspaces?**

    **Answer:** Workspaces allow multiple state files for the same configuration, useful for managing environments (dev, prod).

24. **How do workspaces differ from directories?**

    **Answer:** Workspaces manage state within the same configuration, while directories are isolated. Workspaces are lightweight.

25. **When should you use workspaces?**

    **Answer:** For minor environment differences (dev/test/prod) with the same infrastructure layout. Avoid for significant architecture changes.

26. **What are Terraform modules?**

    **Answer:** Modules are reusable sets of Terraform configurations. Each `.tf` directory is a module.

27. **How do you create a module?**

    **Answer:** Create a directory with `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`. Reference it with:
    ```hcl
    module "vpc" {
      source = "./modules/vpc"
    }
    ```

28. **What are the benefits of modules?**

    **Answer:**
    * Reuse
    * Separation of concerns
    * Cleaner main configurations
    * Easier team collaboration

29. **Root vs child module?**

    **Answer:**
    * Root module: The configuration you run `terraform` on
    * Child module: Called from within the root or other modules

30. **How do you version modules?**

    **Answer:** Use versioned Git tags or Terraform Registry versioning. Example:
    ```hcl
    source = "git::https://github.com/org/module.git?ref=v1.0.0"
    ```

31. **Can a module call another module?**

    **Answer:** Yes, nesting is supported. Useful for composing complex infra.

32. **Best practice to pass secrets to modules?**

    **Answer:** Use sensitive variables, pass via environment (`TF_VAR_`), or secret managers (Vault, SSM).

33. **How do you debug a module error?**

    **Answer:** Use `terraform plan`, verbose logs (`TF_LOG=DEBUG`), and `terraform console`.

34. **What is the `source` argument in modules?**

    **Answer:** It tells Terraform where to find the module (local path, registry, Git, etc.).

35. **What happens if you change a module's code?**

    **Answer:** The changes will reflect wherever the module is used upon next plan/apply, which may trigger resource changes.

36. **What are provisioners in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** They allow scripts or actions to run during creation or destruction, like installing software via SSH.

37. **When should you use `local-exec` vs `remote-exec`?**

    **Answer:**
    * `local-exec`: Runs on the machine executing Terraform
    * `remote-exec`: Runs on the remote provisioned resource (e.g., EC2)

38. **Why are provisioners discouraged?**

    **Answer:**
    * Not idempotent
    * Harder to debug
    * May fail after resource creation
    * Better handled by config mgmt tools (Ansible, etc.)

39. **How to run a shell script after EC2 creation?**

    **Answer:** Use `remote-exec` provisioner:
    ```hcl
    provisioner "remote-exec" {
      inline = ["bash install.sh"]
    }
    ```

40. **What does `depends_on` do?**

    **Answer:** Explicitly defines resource dependencies to control execution order.

41. **What is `count` in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** A meta-argument to create multiple instances of a resource.
    ```hcl
    count = 3
    ```

42. **What‚Äôs the difference between `count` and `for_each`?**

    **Answer:**
    * `count`: Indexed, uses numeric
    * `for_each`: Key-value iteration, more flexible

43. **What are dynamic blocks?**

    **Answer:** Used to dynamically generate nested blocks using loops.
    ```hcl
    dynamic "tag" {
      for_each = var.tags
      content {
        key = tag.key
        value = tag.value
      }
    }
    ```

44. **What is the `lifecycle` block?**

    **Answer:** Controls resource creation behavior:
    * `create_before_destroy`
    * `prevent_destroy`
    * `ignore_changes`

45. **How does `create_before_destroy` help?**

    **Answer:** Avoids downtime by creating a new resource before deleting the old one (used in rolling updates).

46. **What are functions in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** Built-in helpers like `join()`, `lookup()`, `length()`, etc., used in expressions.

47. **How does string interpolation work?**

    **Answer:**
    * Old style: `"${var.name}"`
    * Modern: `"Hello ${var.name}"` or `"${aws_instance.web.*.public_ip}"`

48. **Example of useful Terraform functions?**

    * `length(list)`
    * `join(",", list)`
    * `lookup(map, key, default)`
    * `file("file.txt")`

49. **How to convert a list to a map in Terraform?**

    **Answer:** Use `zipmap()`

    ```hcl
    zipmap(["a", "b"], [1, 2])
    ```

50. **How can you use conditionals in Terraform?**

    **Answer:**

    ```hcl
    instance_type = var.is_prod ? "t3.large" : "t3.micro"
    ```

---

### Section 3 üî∏ **Terraform State Management**

**81. What is the purpose of Terraform state?**

Terraform state represents the real infrastructure deployed. It maps resources in `.tf` files to actual resources in the cloud, enabling change tracking, dependencies, and efficient planning.

---

**82. Where is the Terraform state stored by default?**

In a local file named `terraform.tfstate` in the working directory.

---

**83. What are the drawbacks of local state?**

* Hard to collaborate
* Susceptible to loss/corruption
* No locking
* Doesn‚Äôt scale across teams

---

**84. What are remote backends in Terraform?**

Backends like `s3`, `gcs`, `azurerm`, etc., which store the `.tfstate` file in a central remote location and optionally provide state locking.

---

**85. What are the benefits of using a remote backend?**

* Shared state for teams
* Locking to avoid race conditions
* Backup and audit logging
* Centralized governance

---

**86. What is state locking in Terraform?**

Prevents concurrent writes to the state file, avoiding corruption. Supported by backends like S3 (with DynamoDB lock table), Terraform Cloud, Consul, etc.

---

**87. How do you enable locking for S3 backend?**

Configure a DynamoDB table and link it in the backend block:

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket         = "my-tfstate"
  key            = "prod/vpc.tfstate"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  encrypt        = true
}
```

---

**88. How does Terraform detect drift in state?**

By comparing real-world infrastructure (via provider API) with values in `.tfstate` during `terraform plan`.

---

**89. What happens if the `.tfstate` file is deleted?**

Terraform forgets about deployed resources. A `terraform plan` will propose re-creating everything, risking duplication.

---

**90. Can `.tfstate` contain secrets?**

Yes. Sensitive outputs or resource attributes (like `db_password`) may appear unless you handle them carefully.

---

**91. How do you protect secrets in state?**

* Avoid printing sensitive values
* Use secure remote backends
* Enable state encryption (e.g., S3 encryption + KMS)
* Avoid using `output` for secrets

---

**92. What is the `.tfstate.backup` file?**

It stores the previous known good state. Automatically created before overwriting the main `terraform.tfstate`.

---

**93. How can you manually inspect a state file?**

It‚Äôs JSON ‚Äî use:

```bash
terraform show -json terraform.tfstate
```

Or open in an editor.

---

**94. How can you list all resources in a state file?**

```bash
terraform state list
```

---

**95. How do you remove a resource from state without destroying it?**

```bash
terraform state rm <resource_address>
```

---

**96. How to import an existing resource into Terraform state?**

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.web i-12345678
```

---

**97. What is `terraform refresh`?**

Updates state file to reflect the latest actual infrastructure without making changes.

---

**98. How do you move a resource in state from one module to another?**

```bash
terraform state mv 'module.old.aws_s3_bucket.b' 'module.new.aws_s3_bucket.b'
```

---

**99. What is a partial state file?**

A file that contains only part of the state (e.g., generated by `terraform plan -out`). Not a full `.tfstate`.

---

**100. Can you encrypt local state?**

Not by default. You must manually store it in an encrypted filesystem or use a remote backend with encryption support.

---

**101. How to handle merge conflicts in remote state backends?**

Use locking backends (S3 + DynamoDB) or Terraform Cloud which blocks parallel access.

---

**102. How to debug state file corruption?**

* Check `.tfstate.backup`
* Validate using `terraform validate`
* Use `terraform show` to inspect
* Rollback or manually fix JSON (as last resort)

---

**103. How to migrate from local state to remote backend?**

Update `backend` block ‚Üí run `terraform init` ‚Üí confirm migration.

---

**104. Can you use multiple state files?**

Yes, by separating `backend` keys or using `terraform.workspace` or subdirectories per env.

---

**105. What is a workspace in Terraform?**

Workspaces allow multiple state files from the same configuration (e.g., `default`, `dev`, `prod`). Useful for environment isolation.

---

**106. How to create and use a workspace?**

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace select dev
```

---

**107. Where is the workspace state stored remotely?**

Usually as a separate file in the backend. For example, S3 will store `env_name/resource.tfstate` if you configure key dynamically.

---

**108. Should you use workspaces for all environments?**

Only if infra layout is the same. If different (e.g., prod has VPC peering), use directories/modules instead.

---

**109. How to list and delete workspaces?**

```bash
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace delete dev
```

---

**110. Can you lock state manually in Terraform?**

No. Locking is handled by the backend. If backend supports it (like S3 + DynamoDB), it's automatic.

---


### Section 4 ‚Äî Modules & Reusability

**Q111. What is a Terraform module?**

A Terraform module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. It helps organize and encapsulate infrastructure code for reuse, abstraction, and better management.

**Q112. What is the difference between a root module and a child module?**

* **Root module:** The directory where Terraform is run (the main config).
* **Child module:** A module called by another module using the `module` block.

**Q113. How do you call a child module from a root module?**

Use a `module` block specifying the source path (local or remote), e.g.:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "./modules/vpc"
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

**Q114. What are module inputs and outputs?**

* **Inputs:** Variables defined in a module via `variable` blocks, passed from calling module.
* **Outputs:** Values exported by a module using `output` blocks to be consumed by parent or other modules.

**Q115. Can you nest modules? How?**

Yes. Modules can call other modules, forming a hierarchy. Nest by calling child modules inside another module‚Äôs configuration.

**Q116. How do you version and publish reusable modules?**

Use version control tags (e.g., Git tags or semantic versioning). Publish modules in registries like Terraform Registry or private registries.

**Q117. What is the purpose of the `source` argument in a module block?**

It tells Terraform where to find the module code ‚Äî local path, Git URL, registry, or other sources.

**Q118. How do you handle sensitive inputs and outputs in modules?**

Mark variables as `sensitive = true` to prevent values from showing in logs or output. Handle sensitive outputs similarly.

**Q119. What is the difference between a module and a provider?**

* **Provider:** Manages API communication with cloud or services (AWS, Azure, etc.)
* **Module:** Group of resources that use providers to create infrastructure.

**Q120. What are some benefits of using modules?**

* Code reuse and DRY principle
* Encapsulation and abstraction
* Easier testing and maintenance
* Team collaboration and standardization

**Q121. How does Terragrunt help with Terraform modules?**

Terragrunt is a thin wrapper for Terraform that helps manage remote state, locking, and complex workflows with modules, making code DRYer and easier to maintain.

**Q122. How do you override default variable values in a module call?**

Pass values explicitly in the module block:

```hcl
module "db" {
  source = "./modules/db"
  instance_type = "db.m5.large"
}
```

**Q123. What happens if you don‚Äôt specify a required variable in a module call?**

Terraform will throw an error during `terraform plan` or `apply`, indicating the missing variable.

**Q124. How can you share outputs between modules?**

Capture outputs from one module and pass them as inputs to another module, e.g.:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
}

module "compute" {
  source = "./modules/compute"
  subnet_ids = module.network.subnet_ids
}
```

**Q125. How do you test modules before deploying them?**

Use tools like `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, Terratest, or InSpec to write automated tests against module code.


**Q126. What is a ‚Äúmodule registry‚Äù in Terraform?**

A module registry is a centralized place (like the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io)) where you can publish and discover reusable Terraform modules.

**Q127. How do you specify a module version when using the Terraform Registry?**

Use the `version` argument inside the module block:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.14.0"
}
```

**Q128. How do you upgrade a module version safely?**

* Update the `version` in the module block.
* Run `terraform init -upgrade` to fetch the new version.
* Review changes with `terraform plan` before applying.

**Q129. What is the purpose of `count` and `for_each` inside modules?**

They allow creating multiple instances of resources or modules dynamically based on a list, map, or number.

**Q130. Can you pass a list or map to a module variable? How?**

Yes. Define the variable as `list` or `map` type, then pass the collection when calling the module.

**Q131. How do you handle conditional resource creation inside modules?**

Use `count = var.create_resource ? 1 : 0` or the newer `for_each` with conditions to toggle resource creation.

**Q132. How do you keep module code DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)?**

* Use variables and outputs effectively.
* Use nested modules to break down complex infra.
* Leverage Terragrunt or other tools to manage repetitive patterns.

`depends_on` creates explicit dependencies between resources or modules to control apply order. It can be used in modules to ensure dependencies.

**Q134. How do you pass provider configurations to child modules?**

Child modules inherit providers by default. For multiple providers or aliases, pass providers explicitly via the `providers` argument in the module block.

**Q135. How do you handle module version constraints?**

Use semantic version constraints in the `version` argument, e.g., `>= 1.0, < 2.0` to control upgrades safely.

**Q136. What are some best practices for writing reusable modules?**

* Use clear inputs/outputs
* Document variables and outputs
* Avoid hardcoding values
* Support variable validation
* Keep modules focused and single-purpose

**Q137. How do you debug issues inside modules?**

* Registry modules (`terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws`)
* Archived files (`https://example.com/module.zip`)

**Q140. How can you enforce module usage standards across a team?**

* Use private registries with approved modules
* Enforce version constraints
* Use CI/CD pipelines with validation
* Implement code reviews and module testing


### Section 5 ‚Äî Providers & Resources

**Q141. What is a Terraform provider?**

A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to interact with cloud platforms and services (like AWS, Azure, GCP) by managing API calls and resource lifecycle.

**Q142. How do you declare a provider in Terraform?**

Using the `provider` block, for example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

**Q143. What is provider aliasing and when would you use it?**

Provider aliasing allows configuring multiple instances of the same provider with different settings. Useful for managing resources across multiple accounts or regions.
Example:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  provider = aws.us_west
  # ...
}
```

**Q144. How does Terraform manage resource dependencies?**

Terraform automatically infers dependencies from resource references but you can use `depends_on` for explicit control.

**Q145. What is the difference between a resource and a data source in Terraform?**

* **Resource:** Creates or manages infrastructure components.
* **Data source:** Reads or fetches information from existing infrastructure without managing it.

**Q146. How can you define multiple resources of the same type dynamically?**

Using `count` or `for_each` meta-arguments.

**Q147. What are lifecycle meta-arguments in Terraform resources?**

Arguments like `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`, and `ignore_changes` that control resource creation and destruction behavior.

**Q148. How do you prevent Terraform from destroying a resource accidentally?**

Set `prevent_destroy = true` inside the resource's `lifecycle` block.

**Q149. What is the purpose of `create_before_destroy`?**

Ensures new resources are created before old ones are destroyed, avoiding downtime.

**Q150. How do you handle resource updates that require replacement?**

Terraform plans to destroy and recreate resources if an update cannot be done in-place; use lifecycle options to control behavior.

**Q151. What is the role of provider versions in Terraform?**

Provider versions ensure compatibility and stability; you specify versions in the `required_providers` block.

**Q152. How do you specify provider version constraints?**

In Terraform 0.13+, use:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Q153. Can you configure multiple providers of different types in the same Terraform configuration?**

Yes, simply declare multiple `provider` blocks for each cloud or service.

**Q154. What is provider injection in child modules?**

Passing configured providers explicitly from a parent module to child modules to avoid ambiguity.

**Q155. How do you read existing resources with Terraform?**

Use `terraform import` to import existing resources into state, or use `data` sources to query existing infrastructure.

**Q156. How does Terraform handle resource naming conflicts?**

Resource names must be unique within the same module; otherwise Terraform throws errors.

**Q157. How can you tag resources for cost tracking or management?**

Pass tags via resource arguments like `tags = { Name = "example", Env = "prod" }`.

**Q158. What is the difference between managed and unmanaged resources?**

* **Managed:** Created and tracked by Terraform.
* **Unmanaged:** Existing resources outside Terraform management.

**Q159. How do you configure provider authentication?**

Via environment variables, shared credentials files, or explicit provider block parameters.

**Q160. Can you override default provider endpoints?**

Yes, for testing or custom endpoints, providers may support overriding API URLs.


**Q161. What is the purpose of the `alias` attribute in provider blocks?**

It allows defining multiple provider configurations of the same type, each identified by a unique alias, useful for multi-region or multi-account setups.

**Q162. How do you reference an aliased provider in a resource or module?**

Specify the provider in the resource or module block:

```hcl
provider = aws.us_east
```

**Q163. How does Terraform handle provider plugins during initialization?**

Terraform downloads and installs required provider plugins during `terraform init` based on configuration and version constraints.

**Q164. Can you use different versions of the same provider in a single Terraform configuration?**

No, Terraform currently requires a single version per provider per configuration.

**Q165. How do you specify the provider source in Terraform 0.13 and later?**

In `required_providers` under `terraform` block with `source` and `version`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Q166. What is a provider schema?**

It defines the structure, configuration options, and capabilities exposed by a provider.

By writing Go code using the Terraform Plugin SDK, compiling it, and distributing the binary.

**Q169. What is the role of the `data` block in Terraform?**

To fetch or query existing resources or data without managing lifecycle.

**Q170. How do you handle provider configuration inheritance in nested modules?**

By default, child modules inherit provider configs from the root, but can be overridden explicitly.

**Q171. What is the purpose of the `ignore_changes` lifecycle argument?**

It tells Terraform to ignore changes to specific resource attributes to avoid unnecessary updates.

**Q172. How can you manage resource dependencies that are not explicit?**

Use `depends_on` to manually specify dependencies.

**Q173. What are provisioners in Terraform?**

Provisioners run scripts or commands on resources after creation or before destruction, e.g., `local-exec` or `remote-exec`.

**Q174. Why should provisioners be used sparingly?**

They can introduce ordering issues and aren‚Äôt idempotent; Terraform recommends native resources or external tools instead.

**Q175. How can you handle provider credentials securely?**

Use environment variables, secrets managers, or encrypted files, and avoid hardcoding credentials.

**Q176. What happens if a provider plugin is missing during `terraform apply`?**

Terraform will fail to execute and prompt to run `terraform init` to download missing plugins.

**Q177. How do resource meta-arguments affect provisioning order?**

`depends_on` and `lifecycle` control the order and behavior of resource creation, updates, and destruction.

**Q178. How do you roll back a failed Terraform apply?**

Terraform does not automatically roll back; manual intervention or `terraform destroy` and re-apply is needed.

**Q179. Can providers manage resources outside of cloud platforms?**

Yes, there are providers for SaaS products, DNS, databases, etc.

**Q180. How do you debug provider issues?**

Enable detailed logs with `TF_LOG=DEBUG`, check provider docs, and validate configs.

**Q181. What is the purpose of provider configuration aliases in multi-cloud or multi-region setups?**

They enable multiple provider instances with different credentials or regions to coexist in the same configuration.

**Q182. How do you declare a provider with multiple regions in AWS?**

By defining multiple provider blocks with aliases for each region, e.g.:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us_west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

**Q183. How do you associate resources with a specific aliased provider?**

Specify the provider attribute in the resource block:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  provider = aws.us_west
  # ...
}
```

**Q184. Can you override provider configurations inside modules?**

Yes, by passing providers explicitly to modules using the `providers` argument.

**Q185. What is the `terraform` block used for in Terraform configuration files?**

It configures Terraform settings like required providers, backend, and version constraints.

**Q186. What is the difference between `terraform import` and `data` sources?**

* `terraform import` adds existing resources to state for management.
* `data` sources read existing resources without managing them.

**Q187. How do you use a data source to fetch information about an existing AWS VPC?**

Example:

```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "main" {
  default = true
}
```

**Q188. How do lifecycle meta-arguments help avoid downtime during resource replacement?**

`create_before_destroy = true` creates the replacement resource first before destroying the old one.

**Q189. What is the role of the `prevent_destroy` lifecycle meta-argument?**

It prevents accidental destruction of critical resources unless explicitly overridden.

**Q190. How does Terraform ensure idempotency when managing resources?**

By comparing desired configuration with current state and only applying changes when differences exist.

**Q191. What does the `resource` block represent in Terraform?**

It declares an infrastructure object to create, update, or delete.

**Q192. How do you configure a resource to depend on another resource explicitly?**

Using `depends_on`, e.g.:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  depends_on = [aws_vpc.main]
}
```

**Q193. What is the significance of provider version locking?**

To ensure consistent behavior and avoid breaking changes across Terraform runs.

**Q194. How can you configure Terraform to use a specific version of a provider?**

Set the version in the `required_providers` block inside `terraform` block.

**Q196. How do you handle multiple provider configurations for different environments?**

Use provider aliases and conditional variables to configure providers dynamically.

**Q197. What‚Äôs the difference between managed resource creation and data lookup?**

Managed resources create/update infrastructure; data lookups only read existing info.

**Q198. How do you manage secrets when using providers that require sensitive info?**

Use environment variables, Vault, or encrypted storage rather than plaintext in configs.

**Q199. What is the importance of the provider schema?**

It defines what configuration options and resources are available from a provider.

**Q200. How does Terraform handle resource drift?**

By comparing the current state with the actual infrastructure, it detects drift during `terraform plan`.

Resource creation, update, and deletion behaviors, including `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`, and `ignore_changes`.

**Q211. What does `create_before_destroy` do?**

Ensures a new resource is created before the existing one is destroyed during updates.

**Q212. What is `prevent_destroy`?**

A lifecycle setting that prevents accidental resource deletion unless explicitly overridden.

**Q213. How does `ignore_changes` work?**

It instructs Terraform to ignore specified attribute changes when planning updates.

**Q214. Can you use `depends_on` with modules?**

Yes, to specify dependencies between modules.

**Q215. What happens if you don‚Äôt specify `depends_on` but have implicit dependencies?**

Terraform will infer dependencies based on resource references automatically.

**Q216. How can `count` and `for_each` be used in modules and resources?**

To create multiple instances dynamically based on input lists, maps, or numbers.

**Q217. What is the difference between `count` and `for_each`?**

**Q218. How do meta-arguments affect resource lifecycle?**

They influence the order, creation, destruction, and update behavior of resources.

**Q219. Can you use provisioners in remote backend setups?**

Yes, but remote execution depends on network access and connectivity to target resources.

**Q220. How do you troubleshoot failed provisioners?**

Check Terraform logs (`TF_LOG`), provisioner output, and ensure proper connectivity and credentials.

**Q221. How do you ensure idempotency when using provisioners?**

By writing scripts or commands that safely handle repeated executions without adverse effects, often by checking current state before making changes.

**Q222. What are some common use cases for `local-exec` provisioners?**

Running local scripts, triggering configuration management tools, or executing external commands after resource creation.

**Q223. How does Terraform handle provisioner failures during apply?**

By default, a provisioner failure causes the entire apply to fail and rolls back changes.

**Q224. Can provisioners be used during resource destruction?**

Yes, using the `when = destroy` argument inside the provisioner block.

**Q225. What is the syntax to run provisioners only during resource creation?**

Set `when = create` inside the provisioner block (default behavior).

**Q226. How can you pass variables or outputs into provisioner scripts?**

Use Terraform interpolation syntax `${var.example}` or `${module.module_name.output}` inside provisioner commands.

**Q227. What is the role of the `on_failure` argument in provisioners?**

It controls behavior when a provisioner fails, e.g., `continue` or `fail` the apply.

**Q228. How do you execute multiple commands in a single `remote-exec` provisioner?**

Use the `inline` argument with a list of commands.

**Q229. Can provisioners create or destroy resources?**

No, provisioners only execute commands; resource creation/destruction is managed by Terraform resources.

**Q230. What are ‚Äúnull resources‚Äù and how do they relate to provisioners?**

`null_resource` is a resource that performs no infrastructure change but can run provisioners and triggers.

**Q231. What is the purpose of the `triggers` argument in `null_resource`?**

To define values that cause the resource (and its provisioners) to re-run when changed.

**Q232. How do you avoid running provisioners on every apply?**

Use `triggers` to only re-run when specific inputs change.

**Q233. What is the difference between `depends_on` and `triggers` in terms of provisioners?**

* `depends_on` controls resource creation order.
* `triggers` control when a `null_resource` re-executes provisioners.

**Q234. How does Terraform treat provisioner output?**

Provisioner output is shown during apply but not stored in state or available after.

**Q235. Can provisioners access Terraform variables directly?**

**Q281. How do you manage IAM policies with Terraform on AWS?**

In AWS, IAM policies can be managed declaratively using Terraform resources such as `aws_iam_policy` for creating standalone policies, and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` to attach these policies to roles or users. Policies are typically defined as JSON documents, either inline or in separate files, allowing precise control over permissions. Careful structuring and versioning help avoid permission conflicts or accidental privilege escalations.

**Q282. What considerations should you keep in mind when designing a VPC in AWS using Terraform?**

When designing a VPC, you must carefully plan the CIDR blocks to avoid overlaps, define subnets to separate public and private resources, configure route tables properly to control traffic flow, and set up internet gateways or NAT gateways depending on whether instances require internet access. Security groups and network ACLs should be tightly controlled to enforce the principle of least privilege.

**Q283. How does Terraform facilitate the deployment and scaling of EC2 instances?**

Terraform uses the `aws_instance` resource to manage EC2 instances. You specify instance types, AMIs, key pairs, security groups, and user data scripts for configuration on boot. Scaling can be managed by using `count` or `for_each` to provision multiple instances dynamically or by integrating with autoscaling groups (`aws_autoscaling_group`) to automatically manage scaling based on load.

**Q284. Describe how to manage database instances such as AWS RDS with Terraform.**

AWS RDS instances are managed through the `aws_db_instance` resource where you specify engine type, version, instance class, allocated storage, subnet groups, and backup configurations. Terraform allows easy modification of database parameters, scaling, and upgrades while maintaining state to track changes and prevent configuration drift.

**Q285. What is the importance of security groups in cloud resource management and how does Terraform handle them?**

Security groups act as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic to resources. Terraform manages security groups through resources like `aws_security_group` where you define ingress and egress rules. It ensures security groups are consistent with the intended access policies and can associate them easily with instances, databases, or load balancers.

**Q286. How can you deploy serverless functions like AWS Lambda using Terraform?**

Terraform provides the `aws_lambda_function` resource to deploy Lambda functions, including specifying the runtime, handler, function code, environment variables, and execution roles. Additionally, triggers such as API Gateway endpoints, S3 bucket events, or CloudWatch events can be configured to invoke these functions automatically.

**Q287. Explain how Terraform integrates with AWS S3 for remote state management.**

Terraform supports S3 as a remote backend where the state file is stored securely. This enables shared access and collaboration. Typically, you configure the backend with the S3 bucket name, key (path), region, and optionally a DynamoDB table to provide state locking and prevent concurrent modifications.

**Q288. What are some unique features of the Google Cloud Platform provider in Terraform?**

The GCP provider supports resources such as `google_compute_instance`, `google_sql_database_instance`, and `google_storage_bucket`, among others. It integrates with Google IAM for fine-grained access control and supports automatic management of service accounts and keys. The provider leverages Google APIs and supports complex networking, billing, and resource hierarchy constructs unique to GCP.

**Q289. How do you assign IAM roles in GCP using Terraform?**

Terraform allows IAM role assignments via `google_project_iam_member` or `google_project_iam_binding`. You specify the project, role, and member (user, service account, or group). These resources help you manage permissions declaratively and ensure consistent access policies across projects.

**Q290. What best practices should be followed when managing Azure infrastructure with Terraform?**

In Azure, it is advisable to use resource groups for logical organization, consistently tag resources for tracking, manage state securely using Azure Blob Storage as a backend, and leverage Azure‚Äôs RBAC for controlled access. Using modular Terraform configurations and aligning with Azure resource hierarchies improves maintainability.

**Q291. How do you provision an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and subnets with Terraform?**

Terraform's `azurerm_virtual_network` resource is used to define the address space and other VNet properties. Subnets are created using `azurerm_subnet` with their own CIDR blocks.

### Q462. How does Terraform's dependency graph optimize resource provisioning?

Terraform constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of resources based on dependencies to determine the correct order for creating, updating, or deleting resources efficiently and safely.

### Q463. What are the benefits and risks of using `create_before_destroy` lifecycle meta-argument?

Benefits include zero downtime updates by creating new resources before deleting old ones; risks involve increased resource usage and potential quota exhaustion during overlap.

### Q464. How does Terraform handle resource tainting, and when is it useful?

Tainting marks a resource for destruction and recreation on the next apply, useful when a resource is corrupted or out-of-sync and manual recreation is needed.

### Q465. What are the key features of Terraform Cloud relevant to team collaboration?

Remote state storage and locking, policy enforcement via Sentinel, run environment isolation, variable management, and VCS integration improve teamwork and governance.

### Q466. Explain the difference between Terraform state and the real infrastructure.

Terraform state is a local or remote snapshot mapping Terraform configurations to real infrastructure; real infrastructure is the actual deployed environment. Drift can occur if they differ.

### Q467. How does Terraform ensure idempotency in infrastructure provisioning?

By maintaining state and only applying changes when the desired state differs from the current state, Terraform ensures repeated applies result in the same infrastructure without unintended side effects.

### Q468. What is the purpose of the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file?

It records exact versions of providers used, enabling reproducible Terraform runs by locking dependency versions.

### Q469. Describe the process of migrating state from local to a remote backend.

Backup current state, configure the remote backend in Terraform, run `terraform init -migrate-state` to transfer state safely, and verify correctness after migration.

### Q470. What are dynamic blocks in Terraform and when would you use them?

Dynamic blocks generate repeated nested blocks programmatically within resources or modules, useful when the number or content of blocks depends on variables or lists.

### Q471. How do Terraform provisioners differ from providers?

Providers manage infrastructure resources via APIs, while provisioners execute scripts or commands on resources for configuration after creation or before destruction.

### Q472. What causes ‚Äúresource drift‚Äù and how can it be detected?

Drift occurs when real infrastructure changes outside Terraform, detected by `terraform plan` showing differences or via external monitoring tools.

### Q473. How do you rollback changes in Terraform if something goes wrong?

Terraform does not have built-in rollback; you can apply a previous state by restoring backups or use version control and CI/CD pipeline rollback strategies.

### Q474. How do Terraform modules enhance code maintainability?

Modules encapsulate reusable infrastructure code, promote consistency, simplify complex setups, and allow isolated testing and versioning.

### Q475. What strategies improve performance in Terraform runs with large infrastructures?

`depends_on` explicitly sets resource dependencies that Terraform might not infer, ensuring resources are created or destroyed in the correct order.

### Q480. What are Terraform workspaces and how do they support environment segregation?

Workspaces are isolated state environments within a backend, enabling multiple deployments (e.g., dev, prod) from the same configuration without state conflicts.

### Q481. How do you handle secrets in Terraform state files?

Avoid storing secrets in plaintext; use sensitive variables, encrypt remote backends, and integrate with secret management tools like Vault.

### Q482. What are some common Terraform security best practices?

Use least privilege IAM roles, secure state storage, avoid hardcoded secrets, implement policy-as-code, and regularly audit infrastructure.

### Q483. How does Terraform handle resource lifecycle hooks?

Lifecycle meta-arguments like `create_before_destroy`, `prevent_destroy`, and `ignore_changes` control resource behavior during applies and updates.

### Q484. What is the difference between `terraform apply` and `terraform refresh`?

`apply` makes changes to infrastructure to match the config; `refresh` updates state to reflect real infrastructure without changing resources.

### Q485. How can you debug Terraform plans that fail silently or unexpectedly?

Enable verbose logging (`TF_LOG=DEBUG`), inspect state and configs, validate provider versions, and isolate problem resources.

### Q486. How do you ensure Terraform code quality in a team environment?
